## Build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
```
npm run build
```

``` 
npm run start
```





## Docker

You should create a docker image from Dockerfile.

```
docker build .
```

To start a container from image run the following command:


``` 
docker run -p 3000:3000 <image_id> 
```
This runs the container and mapping port 3000 to port host port 3000

The app will be run on docker container at localhost:3000


Dockerfile already included to project.

```
FROM node:alpine

RUN mkdir -p /opt/app
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY . /opt/app

RUN npm install --dev && npm run build

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```
